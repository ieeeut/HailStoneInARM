# HailStoneInARM
First IEEE Open Source Project: Implement the Hailstone sequence in ARM Assembly Language. 
ARM was chosen since most first-years are fimilar with assembly language, so all grade levels can work on the project. 
One can for fork or pull from this repository. One can also create their own repo and create a team to work on the project. 
I hope to see some code in our repository soon. 
After we see some code being implememented in the group, we will post more Projects.
